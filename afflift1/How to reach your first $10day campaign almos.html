In fact, instead of being a super long guide with a ton of screenshots, steps, and tutorials, you literally just have to follow a few points and as long as you know the basics, you should be able to create your first profitable $10 per day campaign (more or less) in just a few days of testing.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
I have been using this method for a while (7 years) and literally just launched a few campaigns in the last 2 weeks and a couple of them are doing $5-30 per day on autopilot. With NO OPTIMIZATION. No blocked websites, no blocked OSes, no landing pages, NOTHING. I'm just direct linking them and letting them ride as long as they last. That could be weeks or months, we'll see.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
OK, enough with the hype. Let's get started.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Here's what you need:<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<ul style="box-sizing:border-box;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;overflow:hidden;">
<li style="box-sizing:border-box;"><a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/categories/tracking-tools.4/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;">A tracker</a></li>

<li style="box-sizing:border-box;">Basic understanding of how to set up a campaign, postback, Click URLs, and everything.

<li style="box-sizing:border-box;">A budget of $100-200 to test campaigns</li>
</ul>That's it.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>

</div>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Now, if you check the forum you'll see there are a ton of follow alongs struggling with an initial -95% to -80% ROI which usually is very difficult to optimize to profits. Sometimes you work them on and end up with -70% after a week or they even drop more because data wasn't good enough. That's why I like starting with at least -60% to -40% ROIs to see if there's any potential.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
What else are people complaining about here? Volume. Not not the lack of it. The contrary.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
People are scared because their budget was eaten in 5 minutes and they think maybe they should start day parting (no, you shouldn't at that stage of your campaign).<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
And because when you're starting you don't have a big budget you get scared easily if you see your money disappears in 5 minutes with no data left to work with.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Your whole $200 could be spent in 24 hours or less and what did you learn, right?<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
OK, here's another, simple approach I've used from time to time to find small winners when &quot;cold traffic&quot; campaigns aren't working or when I'm lacking good offers that convert with huge mass appeal.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Instead of going from high volume to low volumes after optimizing your campaign, you start with low amounts of volume, but very targeted traffic.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
This, coupled with a few good targeted offers should make you anywhere from $5 to $50 per day, depending on the geo and volume available, as well as other factors such as your offer, the vertical, etc.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
These campaigns tend to be very low-maintenance and sometimes can run for months as long as you keep switching offers (in case the performance goes down or they get paused) or adjust the bids and that's all. Have a full hand of them and you could easily be making an extra $50-200 per month.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Here are the 3 steps you need to follow:<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<b style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-size:26px;">1. Select an offer</span></b><br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Check out some of the top offers being run in your aff networks. Preferably ordered by volume or CR.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Select 2 or 3 to test them and preferably, select offers that go into some sort of vertical such as weight loss, software downloads, finance, web games, streaming, etc.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
The offers you need to avoid in this case are super generic offers that run well but you know everybody wants, such as dating or sweepstakes. You can actually use this strategy with sweepstakes if you customize your landers a lot, but we'll leave that for another post.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
If you want to go for something like dating then don't go generic. Try a specific niche instead such as dating for people over 50, gay dating, or interracial dating or whatever is available.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<div style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;max-width:100%;" title="Ron Burgundy Branding GIF">
<img src="How to reach your first $10day campaign almos_files/200 [1].gif" type="image/gif" data-filename="200.gif" height="" style="border-style:none;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:100%;height:auto;" title="Ron Burgundy Branding GIF" width=""/>
</div>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Also, try starting with simple conversion flows such as SOI, DOI, CPI, Leads, etc. Sales can work here s well but you won't get much data and it the results could be very unstable (1 sale every 3 days, etc.).<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<b style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-size:26px;">2. Choose a traffic source that allows you to do keyword or category targeting</span></b><br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Here's the key for this to work. You need to choose a <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/categories/traffic-sources.1/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">traffic source</a> that allows you to do category targeting (preferably), or keyword targeting at least.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
A few examples that come to my mind are <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/popcash.3/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">PopCash</a>, <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/adcash-push-notifications.123/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">Adcash</a>, <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/zeropark.4/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">Zeropark</a>, <a href="https://afflift.com/f/articles/exoclick-the-unadulterated-source-of-adult-traffic.73/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">Exoclick</a>, <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/popads.2/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">PopAds</a>, <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/tonic.5/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">TONIC</a>, etc.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
If you don't know how category targeting looks, here are a few examples:<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>

</div>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Each traffic source has different categories and subcategories. Check them out to see if any of them fit your offer's vertical.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Or if you want keyword targeting try Zeropark, Tonic, <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/selfadvertiser-ppv.109/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">SelfAdvertiser</a>, <a href="https://afflift.com/f/link-directory/bidvertiser-direct-ads-and-pops.92/" style="background-color:transparent;color:rgb(37, 119, 177);text-decoration:none;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:pointer;" target="_self" title="">Bidvertiser</a>, etc.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
With category targeting, sites that fall under a category are the only ones that get your ads instead of running a RON campaign. This reduces your volume 10x or more, but you get more targeted traffic and if your offer fits the niche, it will convert.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Keep in mind that this categorization isn't super detailed in most networks and also you're working with sites that aren't able to use better ads such as Adsense or native, so many of the sites more or less fall under that category but if you select &quot;finances&quot; don't expect Forbes to show your ads and even if you selected a finance site you could get traffic from anywhere including maybe a coupon site, a MMO site, a link shortener, etc.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Try to aim at bigger geos because you're going to cut a ton of the available traffic once you niche down into a category. You don't want to spend $1 per day and realize there's no traffic.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Also, since you're selecting a specific niche/category, keep in mind your bids need to be up to par. On many occasions, the bid of a category could be 2-10x higher than RON bids.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-size:26px;"><b style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;">3. Wait and optimize, if needed.</b></span><br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
After you've launched your campaign, you'll need to be patient and see if you have enough volume and data. If you're lucky you'll see conversions since day 1, but give it at least 24-48 hours to see if you've got volume and data.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>

</div>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Many times this type of campaign can be profitable right off the bat. Sometimes they just need a few tweaks such as blocking 5 website IDs or a specific browser/OS. If your campaign is close to profit or breaking even it has potential. If have a -95% ROI or close to that feel free to discard that campaign and test another offer or another category.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Also, you might need to adjust your bids if you're not getting enough traffic or if your campaign seems to be performing well and suddenly traffic decreases and conversions stop. This means either other people running in the same categories have adjusted their bids or people running RON are also adjusting their bids.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<b style="box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:700;"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;font-size:26px;">And there you have it</span></b><br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Yup. Easy enough? As you can see, you don't need a high budget for this and your risk will be much lower. Don't get stuck in those super targeted campaigns though. The real money comes once you dominate broad targeting and mass-appeal offers, but for starters and to see your first batch of profits after struggling for a while, I think it's a good choice.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Some campaigns might do just $1-5 per day. But in some geos there's good potential to make $20-50 or even $100 per day with targeted campaigns. What happens if you have 5-20 similar campaigns running in different networks? <img src="How to reach your first $10day campaign almos_files/1f601.png" type="image/png" data-filename="1f601.png" height="22" style="border-style:none;height:auto;box-sizing:border-box;vertical-align:text-bottom;max-width:none;width:1.467em;" title="Beaming face with smiling eyes :grin:" width="22"/><br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
No need for landing pages, but you can always split test the offer pages if your network has more than 1 available per offer.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Also, if you feel comfortable enough, you can use the same strategy but now focus on mass appeal campaigns (e.g. regular dating, sweeps, vouchers) and add a custom landing page. The landing page will do the pre-sell work before you send them to the generic offer. We'll leave that for another post though.<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
<br style="box-sizing:border-box;"/>
Oh, and while profits are not guaranteed, your success rate will be way higher I'm sure. For every 10 campaigns I test with this method, at least 4-6 of them have some potential or get conversions. If you don't find anything profitable, at least I guarantee you'll get your first conversions without it being a push sub offer.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
